# AGENTS.md: Repo Onboarding for AI Agents

## README Hierarchy
- **Root Overview**: README.md – High-level project philosophy, quickstart, prerequisites, installation, architecture (3-tier modular: Low-Level APIs → Experience Templates → Custom Logic), features (VR/AR LBE with AI, haptics, networking), examples (Gunship, FlightSim), and basic troubleshooting.
- **Engine-Specific Guides**:
  - /Plugins/LBEAST/Source/LBEASTCore/README.md (if added) – Core Unreal C++ APIs for LBEAST modules (e.g., AIFacemask, LargeHaptics, EmbeddedSystems).
  - /Plugins/LBEAST/Source/LBEASTEditor/README.md (if added) – Editor tools for Unreal-specific workflows (e.g., UMG GUIs, Replication setup).
- **Advanced/Dev Docs**:
  - /FlightSimExperience/README.md – Template-specific guide for FlightSim (HOTAS input, motion platforms).
  - /Plugins/LBEAST/FirmwareExamples/GunshipExperience/Gunship_Hardware_Specs.md – Hardware integration (ESP32 shields, solenoids, PWM drivers).
  - /docs/contributing.md (future) – Branching rules, testing with Unreal Test Framework, PR guidelines.

Use this tree for context: Root → Source Modules → Templates/Hardware. Prioritize OpenXR for VR tasks; use Unreal Replication + GAS for multiplayer sims. For cross-engine parity, reference sibling Unity repo (github.com/ajcampbell1333/LBEAST_Unity) via shared API mappings in /src/common (if added).

## Code Style Guidelines

### Controller Size Limits
* Target: Controllers should be 500 lines or less. If a controller exceeds this, it's a strong signal that refactoring is needed.
* When a controller grows too large, seek opportunities to extract functionality into focused service classes.

### Method Size Limits
* Target: Methods should be ~30 lines or less. If a method exceeds this, consider breaking it into smaller, focused methods.
* Long methods are harder to understand, test, and maintain. Extract logical chunks into well-named helper methods.
* Exception: Complex initialization methods that set up multiple related objects may exceed this limit, but should still be reviewed for extraction opportunities.

### Interface Naming Conventions
* Prefer verb-style interface names (e.g., `IBridgeEvents`, `IDMXTransport`) over adjective-style names (e.g., `IEventBridgeable`, `IDMXTransportable`).
* Verb-style names describe what the interface does, which is more idiomatic in C++ and aligns with Microsoft's naming conventions.
* This keeps interface names concise and action-oriented, consistent with Unreal Engine's existing patterns.

### Service Extraction Patterns
* If a controller has methods that are just thin wrappers calling subordinate class methods, remove the wrapper and call the subordinate directly.
* Gather like members and methods into their own classes to be referenced by the controller via interfaces and OOP.
* Services should own their dependencies. If a service is the only consumer of certain data structures, move ownership into the service.
* Controllers should compose services, not duplicate their functionality.

### State Machine Refactoring
* Switch-case or if-else chains handling basic state machine logic are great refactoring candidates.
* Use factory patterns to eliminate switch statements in construction logic.
* Use polymorphism (interfaces) to eliminate switch statements in runtime operations.
* If you have switch statements for construction, usage, AND setup, all three can likely be moved into a factory pattern.

### Polymorphism and Interfaces
* Prefer interfaces (IDMXTransport) over concrete types for abstraction.
* Use factory methods on interfaces to encapsulate construction logic.
* Controllers should use polymorphic pointers (IDMXTransport*) rather than mode-specific branches.
* When you see "if (Mode == X) then use ClassX, else if (Mode == Y) then use ClassY", consider an interface with a factory.

### Service Architecture
* Services should be non-UObject classes focused on specific domains (FixtureService, RDMService, ArtNetManager).
* Services own their domain-specific data structures (FixtureService owns FixtureRegistry and FadeEngine).
* Controllers orchestrate services and bridge events to Blueprint, but don't duplicate service logic.
* If functionality is shared across multiple contexts but contains the same logic, encapsulate it as a service.

### Event Bridging Pattern
* Services emit native events (DECLARE_MULTICAST_DELEGATE).
* Controllers forward native events to Blueprint delegates (DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE).
* This keeps UI/Blueprint coupling minimal while allowing services to emit events freely.

### Factory Patterns
* When different modes require different construction parameters, use factory methods on interfaces.
* Factory methods can return setup results with callbacks for mode-specific initialization.
* This moves all mode-specific logic (construction, setup, configuration) into one place.
* Controllers should only call the factory and execute the setup callback - no mode checks needed.

### Ownership Principles
* Controllers own shared resources (UniverseBuffer used by both controller and services).
* Services own domain-specific resources (FixtureRegistry, FadeEngine owned by FixtureService).
* Transport instances are owned by controllers but accessed polymorphically.
* Avoid double ownership - use raw pointers or custom deleters when one object points to another it doesn't own.

### Code Smells to Watch For
* Methods with "InitializeX" / "ShutdownX" pairs that just call X->Initialize() / X->Shutdown() - remove them and just call X->Initialize() as needed. This goes for any wrapper that simply calls a member's passthrough method and does nothing else. If there's a solid reason for wrapping (lifetime, error handling, abstraction, etc.), utilize it or delete the wrapper.
* Methods that directly access registry/buffer that a service also uses - move to service.
* Switch statements that appear in multiple places (construction, usage, cleanup) - use factory pattern.
* Controller methods that are just "get service, call service method" - remove wrapper, expose service accessor.
* Friend declarations that are only needed because wrapper methods exist - remove friend and wrapper.

### Refactoring Workflow
1. Identify the bloat: What's making the controller too large?
2. Find the patterns: Are there switch statements? Wrapper methods? Direct access to shared resources?
3. Extract services: Group related functionality into focused service classes.
4. Use interfaces: Create polymorphic interfaces for similar but different implementations.
5. Factory patterns: Move construction and setup logic into factories.
6. Verify: Controller should be thin orchestrator, services handle implementation.

## Building and Compilation

### UnrealBuildTool (UBT) Usage
* Use UnrealBuildTool (UBT) to compile Unreal Engine projects from the command line.
* Typical UBT location: `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_<VERSION>\Engine\Binaries\DotNET\UnrealBuildTool\UnrealBuildTool.exe`
* Common build command format:
  ```
  UnrealBuildTool.exe <TargetName> <Platform> <Configuration> -Project="<PathToUProject>" -WaitMutex -FromMsBuild
  ```
* Example for Editor target:
  ```
  UnrealBuildTool.exe LBEAST_UnrealPluginEditor Win64 Development -Project="$PWD\LBEAST_UnrealPlugin.uproject" -WaitMutex -FromMsBuild
  ```
* Check for Unreal Engine installation at standard path:
  ```
  Test-Path 'C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.5\Engine\Binaries\DotNET\UnrealBuildTool\UnrealBuildTool.exe'
  ```
* Build output: Exit code 0 = success, Exit code 1 = failure

### Module Renaming
When renaming a module (folder name, Build.cs class name, or module name in IMPLEMENT_MODULE), always perform a full clean build:
1. Delete `Intermediate/` folder: `Remove-Item -Path "Intermediate" -Recurse -Force`
2. Delete `Binaries/` folder (optional but recommended): `Remove-Item -Path "Binaries" -Recurse -Force`
3. Regenerate project files: `UnrealBuildTool.exe -projectfiles -project="<PathToUProject>" -game -rocket -progress`
4. Rebuild: `UnrealBuildTool.exe <TargetName> <Platform> <Configuration> -Project="<PathToUProject>" -WaitMutex -FromMsBuild`

**Why**: Unreal's build system caches module names and file lists. Renaming a module without cleaning can cause the build system to look for files in the old location, resulting in "file not found" errors even though the code is correct.

### Debugging Compilation Errors
* **Error Migration Pattern**: If you comment out a line that has a compilation error, and the same error appears on a different line (usually earlier in the file), this is a strong indicator of a syntax error somewhere higher up in the same file. The compiler is misinterpreting later code due to the earlier syntax issue.
  * **Example**: Error on line 516 → comment it out → error moves to line 338 → comment that out → error moves to line 291. This pattern suggests checking lines 33-34 (DOREPLIFETIME macros with wrong class name) or other syntax issues near the top of the file.
  * **Solution**: Read the entire file from the top, looking for:
    - Incorrect class names in macros (DOREPLIFETIME, GENERATED_BODY, etc.)
    - Missing semicolons or braces
    - Mismatched template brackets
    - Incorrect include paths
    - Forward declaration issues

### Common Issues
* Circular dependencies (move types to shared headers)
* Incomplete type deletions (use raw pointers or forward-declared deleters)
* Missing includes

## C++ Best Practices

### References
* References (`T&`) must be initialized at declaration - `T& x;` does not compile.
* `T&` = C# ref - modifies caller's variable.
* No `out` keyword in C++ - just declare the variable before the call and pass by `T&`.
* `const T&` = pass big data without copy - use for all input params > 8 bytes (`FVector`, `FName`, `FMyStruct`).
* Never return `T&` to a local - dangling reference → crash. Return by value instead (RVO).

### Lambda Capture (Async Safety)
* Never capture `this` or raw `UObject*` in `Async()` - actor may be destroyed.
* Use `TWeakObjectPtr<T>` for all UObject captures:
  ```
  TWeakObjectPtr<AActor> Weak = this;
  Async(..., [Weak]() { if (Weak.Get()) ... });
  ```
* Copy primitives with `[var]` or `[=]` - safe and simple.
* Never use `[&]` unless same-stack, immediate execution - dangling risk.

### TArray & Dynamic Data
* `TArray` is 24 bytes - contains pointer to heap, Num, and Max.
* Array data lives on the heap - the containing object never grows or moves.
* `Add()` may reallocate the heap buffer - object stays in place.
* `TArray` copy is shallow - both arrays point to same heap data.
* Use `Duplicate(Original)` for deep copy when needed.
* Use `MoveTemp(Local)` when adding to `TArray` - avoids heap allocation and copy.

### Move Semantics (T&&)
* `T&&` = rvalue reference - binds to temporaries or `MoveTemp(var)`.
* Move = steal heap data, leave source empty - zero-cost transfer.
* Return big objects by value - move is automatic (RVO or move constructor).
* `MoveTemp(var)` forces move - treat lvalue as rvalue.
* Write move constructors for custom types with heap data - use `MoveTemp` on members.

### Function Best Practices
* Input > 8 bytes → `const T&`
  ```
  void SetLocation(const FVector& Loc);
  ```
* Input ≤ 8 bytes → `T`
  ```
  void SetHealth(int32 Health);
  ```
* Return big data → `T` (let RVO/move handle it)
  ```
  FMyConfig LoadConfig() { ... return Config; }
  ```
* Modify caller → `T&`
  ```
  void AddScore(int32& Score);
  ```
* Take ownership → `T&&`
  ```
  void Store(FMyData&& Data);
  ```

### Unreal Golden Rules
* Always null-check pointers: `if (Actor) ...`
* Never copy UObjects - use pointers or `TWeakObjectPtr`.
* Use `AsyncTask(ENamedThreads::GameThread, ...)` to return to GameThread.
* `TArray::Add(MoveTemp(...))` = zero-cost insert.
* `const T&` = zero-cost read-only access.
* `TWeakObjectPtr` = the only safe way to reference UObjects in async or long-lived contexts.

## NOOP Marking

When generating new code, maintain awareness of all instances of NOOP parts of the implementation that are intended to be implemented later. Mark them clearly with NOOP comments:
```
// NOOP: This functionality will be implemented in a future update
void SomeMethod()
{
    // TODO: Implement actual logic
    return;
}
```
List all such instances in summaries of your work in chat when you're done. This helps track incomplete implementations and prevents confusion about missing functionality.
