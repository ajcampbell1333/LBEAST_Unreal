/**
 * 2DOF Full 360 Flight Sim Experience Template
 * 
 * Pre-configured single-player flight simulator with gyroscope and HOTAS.
 * Combines:
 * - 2DOF gyroscope system (continuous pitch and roll beyond 360°)
 * - HOTAS controller integration (Logitech X56 or Thrustmaster T.Flight)
 * - Secured cockpit with safety harness
 * - No hydraulics - pure gyroscopic rotation
 * 
 * Perfect for realistic flight arcade games, space combat simulators,
 * and any experience requiring full 360° continuous rotation.
 * 
 * ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Space Reset Feature Tracking Requirements
 * 
 * If using the Space Reset feature (bSpaceReset), you MUST use outside-in tracking
 * with trackers mounted to the cockpit frame. LBEAST does NOT provide HMD correction
 * for Space Reset - this is a complex problem that requires cockpit-relative tracking.
 * 
 * Recommended: Bigscreen Beyond 2 + SteamVR Lighthouse with base stations mounted
 * to the cockpit frame (not room walls).
 * 
 * See: FirmwareExamples/FlightSimExperience/README.md for detailed tracking setup
 * instructions and warnings about HMD correction complexity.
