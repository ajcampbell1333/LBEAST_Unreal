 * GoKart button events (fast updates, sent on state change)
 *
 * Data model for efficient struct-based UDP transmission of button states from GoKart ECU.
 *
 * This is a Model (M) in MVC architecture - pure data structure.
 * Designed for UDP transport via LBEAST binary protocol (Channel 310).
 *
 * Binary compatibility: Must match firmware struct exactly.
