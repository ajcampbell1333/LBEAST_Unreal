/**
 * 4DOF Gunship Experience Template
 * 
 * Pre-configured four-player seated VR experience on hydraulic platform.
 * Combines:
 * - 4DOF motion platform:
 *   - Hydraulic platform: pitch, roll (yaw restricted)
 *   - Scissor lift: forward/reverse, up/down
 * - Four player seated positions
 * - LAN multiplayer support
 * - Synchronized motion for all players
 * 
 * Perfect for gunship, helicopter, spaceship, or any multi-crew vehicle
 * experiences requiring shared motion simulation.
