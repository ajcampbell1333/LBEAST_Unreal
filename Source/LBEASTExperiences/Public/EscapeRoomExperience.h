/**
 * Escape Room Experience Template
 * 
 * Pre-configured experience for escape room installations with embedded systems integration.
 * Perfect for interactive escape rooms, puzzle experiences, and narrative-driven LBE.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Narrative state machine for story progression (Intro -> Puzzle1 -> Puzzle2 -> Finale)
 * - Embedded systems integration for door locks, latches, and prop controls
 * - Wireless communication examples for all microcontroller platforms
 * - Example firmware sketches for unlocking mechanisms
 * - Multi-device support for complex room setups
 * 
 * Embedded Systems Integration:
 * This template demonstrates how to integrate microcontroller firmware for:
 * - Door/latch unlocking via wireless commands
 * - Sensor reading (pressure plates, motion sensors, etc.)
 * - LED feedback and status indicators
 * - Haptic feedback for props
 * 
 * See FirmwareExamples/ for example firmware sketches.
