## 📝 Notes

### **Average Total Calculation**

The **average total of ~$45,500** reflects:

1. **Bulk Discounts:** Volume pricing on laptops, VR headsets, and batteries (typically 5–10% off retail)
2. **Optimized Sourcing:** Mix of new and used components (scissor lift, surplus hydraulic components)
3. **Mid-Range Selections:** Choosing mid-tier options within price ranges (e.g., RTX 5070 Ti vs RTX 5080)
4. **Direct Supplier Pricing:** Bypassing retail markup by sourcing from manufacturers/distributors
5. **Package Deals:** Negotiated pricing for complete system purchases

### **Cost Optimization Opportunities**

- **Used Equipment:** Scissor lift and some hydraulic components can be sourced used (20–30% savings)
- **Bulk Purchasing:** Laptops, VR headsets, and batteries benefit from volume discounts
- **Alternative Components:** Consider mid-range laptops (RTX 5070 Ti) instead of top-tier (RTX 5080) for ~$2,000 savings
- **Phased Implementation:** Start with core components and add VR headsets/compute in phases

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Installation/Labor:** Not included (varies by venue and complexity)
- **Software Licensing:** LBEAST SDK is open-source (MIT License)
- **Maintenance/Spares:** Budget 10–15% for spare parts and maintenance
- **Certification/Inspection:** Included in scissor lift cost estimate
- **Shipping/Logistics:** Not included (varies by location)
