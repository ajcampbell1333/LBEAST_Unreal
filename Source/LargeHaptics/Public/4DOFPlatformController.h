/**
 * 4DOF Platform Controller
 * 
 * Specialized controller for 4DOF motion platforms that use:
 * - Tilt (pitch and roll) via hydraulic actuators
 * - Scissor lift (Y and Z translations) via scissor lift mechanism
 * 
 * Used by Experience Genre Templates:
 * - GunshipExperience (4-player seated gunship)
 * - MovingPlatformExperience (single-player standing platform)
 * - CarSimExperience (single-player seated racing/driving simulator)
 * 
 * This subclass provides struct-based transmission methods for efficient
 * UDP communication with hardware ECUs that support these data models.
