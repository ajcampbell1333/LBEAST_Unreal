/**
 * Gun button events (fast updates, sent on state change)
 * 
 * Data model for efficient struct-based UDP transmission of button states from all 4 gun stations.
 * Used by GunshipExperience for low-latency button event handling.
 * 
 * This is a Model (M) in MVC architecture - pure data structure.
 * Designed for UDP transport via LBEAST binary protocol (Channel 310).
 * 
 * Binary compatibility: Must match firmware struct exactly:
 * - bool Button0State[4] (4 bytes)
 * - bool Button1State[4] (4 bytes)
 * - unsigned long Timestamp (4 bytes, uint32)
 * Total: 12 bytes
 * 
 * Update rate: Configurable (default 20 Hz / 50ms)
