## Mechanical Assembly

### Winch Drum Design

**Drum Specifications:**
- **Diameter:** 2-4 inches (determines cable speed)
- **Cable Capacity:** 50-100 feet of cable
- **Material:** Steel or aluminum
- **Mounting:** Direct to gearmotor output shaft or via coupling

**Cable Speed Calculation:**
```
Speed (inches/second) = (Motor RPM / Gear Ratio) * (Drum Circumference / 60)
Example: 200 RPM motor, 50:1 gearbox, 2" diameter drum
Speed = (200 / 50) * (6.28 / 60) = 4 * 0.105 = 0.42 inches/second
```

**For 12 inches/second target:**
- Need higher motor RPM, lower gear ratio, or larger drum diameter
- Example: 2000 RPM motor, 20:1 gearbox, 2" drum = ~10.5 inches/second

### Encoder Mounting

**Option A: Direct Shaft Coupling**
- Couple encoder directly to winch drum shaft
- Requires flexible coupling or precision alignment
- **Pros:** Direct measurement, no backlash
- **Cons:** Requires precise alignment

**Option B: Belt/Pulley Drive**
- Use timing belt or pulley to drive encoder from drum
- 1:1 ratio recommended (or known ratio for calculation)
- **Pros:** Easier mounting, isolation from vibration
- **Cons:** Potential for belt slip (use timing belt)

### Load Cell Mounting (One Per Winch)

**Mounting Location:**
- **Front Winch:** Load cell mounted between front winch cable and front harness attachment point (shoulder-hook)
- **Rear Winch:** Load cell mounted between rear winch cable and rear harness attachment point (pelvis-hook)
- Use swivel/clevis to prevent side loading
- Protect from impact and weather

**Mounting Hardware (Per Winch):**
- Winch cable → Load cell → Swivel/clevis → Harness attachment point
- Ensure load cell is in tension only (no compression or side loads)
- **Independent Monitoring:** Each winch has its own load cell for independent tension measurement

---

## Calibration Procedures

### Encoder Calibration

1. **Measure Winch Drum Circumference:**
   - Measure drum diameter: `D` (inches)
   - Calculate circumference: `C = π * D` (inches)

2. **Configure Encoder Pulses Per Inch:**
   ```cpp
   const float encoderPulsesPerRevolution = 1000.0f;  // Your encoder PPR
   const float winchDrumCircumference = 6.28f;      // Measured circumference
   const float encoderPulsesPerInch = encoderPulsesPerRevolution / winchDrumCircumference;
   ```

3. **Test Position Accuracy:**
   - Move winch known distance (e.g., 12 inches)
   - Verify encoder pulse count matches expected value
   - Adjust `encoderPulsesPerInch` if needed

### Load Cell Calibration (Per Winch)

**⚠️ Important:** Each winch's load cell must be calibrated independently.

**Front Winch Load Cell:**
1. **Tare (Zero) Calibration:**
   - With no load, read front HX711 raw value
   - Set `frontLoadCellZeroOffset` to this value

2. **Scale Calibration:**
   - Apply known weight (e.g., 100 lbs) to front winch
   - Read front HX711 raw value
   - Calculate calibration factor:
     ```cpp
     frontLoadCellCalibrationFactor = KnownWeight / (RawValue - ZeroOffset);
     ```

3. **Test Accuracy:**
   - Apply various known weights to front winch
   - Verify calculated weight matches actual weight
   - Adjust calibration factor if needed

**Rear Winch Load Cell:**
- Repeat same calibration procedure for rear winch load cell
- Use separate calibration factors: `rearLoadCellZeroOffset` and `rearLoadCellCalibrationFactor`

### Motor Speed Calibration

1. **Measure Maximum Speed:**
   - Set PWM to 255 (100%)
   - Measure time to move known distance
   - Calculate actual max speed (inches/second)

2. **Configure Speed Mapping:**
   ```cpp
   const float maxSpeed = 12.0f;  // Measured max speed (inches/second)
   // PWM = (TargetSpeed / maxSpeed) * 255
   ```

## Battery Management & Monitoring

### Battery Voltage Monitoring

**ESP32 ADC Input for Battery Voltage:**
- **Part:** Voltage Divider Circuit (2 resistors)
- **Wiring:**
  ```
  24V Battery (+) ──→ [R1: 10kΩ] ──→ ESP32 GPIO 34 (ADC1_CH6)
                                      ──→ [R2: 2.2kΩ] ──→ GND
  ```
- **Calculation:**
  ```
  ADC Reading (0-4095) → Voltage = (ADC / 4095) * 3.3V * (R1+R2)/R2
  Example: ADC = 3000 → Voltage = (3000/4095) * 3.3 * (10k+2.2k)/2.2k = 0.73 * 3.3 * 5.45 = 13.1V
  Wait, that's wrong for 24V. Let me recalculate:
  
  For 24V max: Voltage Divider Ratio = 24V / 3.3V = 7.27
  R1 = 10kΩ, R2 = 1.5kΩ → Ratio = (10k+1.5k)/1.5k = 7.67 ✓
  
  Voltage = (ADC / 4095) * 3.3V * 7.67
  Example: ADC = 3000 → Voltage = (3000/4095) * 3.3 * 7.67 = 18.5V
  ```

**Firmware Implementation:**
```cpp
// Battery voltage monitoring (add to firmware)
const int batteryVoltagePin = 34;  // ADC1_CH6 (GPIO 34)
const float voltageDividerRatio = 7.67f;  // (R1+R2)/R2

float readBatteryVoltage() {
  int adcValue = analogRead(batteryVoltagePin);
  float voltage = (adcValue / 4095.0f) * 3.3f * voltageDividerRatio;
  return voltage;
}

// Battery state of charge (SOC) estimation
float estimateBatterySOC(float voltage) {
  // LiFePO4 8S: 28.8V = 100%, 20V = 0%
  // Linear approximation (not perfect, but good enough)
  float soc = ((voltage - 20.0f) / (28.8f - 20.0f)) * 100.0f;
  return clamp(soc, 0.0f, 100.0f);
}
```

### Battery Safety Features

1. **Low Voltage Protection:**
   - Monitor battery voltage continuously
   - Stop winch operation if voltage drops below 22V (10% SOC)
   - Engage brakes and enter safe mode
   - Send low battery warning to Unreal Engine server

2. **Overcurrent Protection:**
   - Motor controller should have built-in overcurrent protection
   - Monitor current draw (if motor controller provides current feedback)
   - Limit peak current to prevent battery damage

3. **Battery Disconnect Switch:**
   - Install manual battery disconnect switch for emergency isolation
   - Mount in accessible location (near console or E-Stop)
   - Use high-current switch (100A+ rating)

4. **Charging Safety:**
   - **Extension Cable Protocol:** Extension cable must be stowed and unplugged during operation
   - **After-Hours Charging:** Plug in extension cable only after operation hours (overnight charging)
   - **Pre-Operation Check:** Ops Tech must verify extension cable is unplugged and stowed before each session
   - **Charger Location:** Charger is integrated in battery enclosure (permanently connected to battery)
   - **Visual Inspection:** Perform visual check of cable storage compartment before operation
   - Monitor battery temperature during charging (BMS handles this automatically)
   - Never charge damaged or swollen batteries

### Battery Life & Maintenance

**Cycle Life:**
- LiFePO4: 2000-5000 cycles (80% capacity retention)
- Daily use (1 cycle/day): 5-13 years of operation
- Proper charging/discharging extends life

**Storage:**
- Store at 50-80% SOC if not in use for extended periods
- Store in cool, dry location
- Check voltage monthly if stored long-term

**Replacement Indicators:**
- Capacity drops below 80% of original
- Voltage sags significantly under load
- BMS reports cell imbalance issues

## Safety Considerations

### Hardware Safety

1. **Fail-Safe Brake (One Per Winch):**
   - Each winch has its own independent electromagnetic brake
   - Brake engages when power is removed (LOW signal)
   - Test brake engagement on power loss for each winch independently
   - Verify each brake holds load when engaged
   - **Redundancy:** If one brake fails, the other winch's brake can still provide safety

2. **Emergency Stop:**
   - Hardware E-Stop button interrupts motor control
   - E-Stop immediately engages brakes
   - E-Stop must be easily accessible

3. **Overload Protection (Per Winch):**
   - Monitor each winch's load cell independently
   - Stop motors if either winch's load exceeds 300 lbs
   - Implement software limits in firmware for each winch
   - **Independent Monitoring:** Each winch's tension is monitored separately for safety compliance

4. **Position Limits:**
   - Software limits: Stop at max height (120 inches)
   - Hardware limit switches (optional but recommended)
   - Prevent over-travel in both directions

### Software Safety

1. **Redundancy:**
   - Dual-winch system provides redundancy
   - If one winch fails, other can support load (at reduced capacity)
   - Monitor both winches independently

2. **Watchdog Timer:**
   - Implement watchdog to detect firmware crashes
   - Auto-engage brakes on watchdog timeout

3. **Network Timeout:**
   - If no commands received for 2+ seconds, engage brakes
   - Prevents runaway if network fails

4. **Battery Low Voltage Protection:**
   - Monitor battery voltage continuously
   - Stop operation if voltage < 22V (10% SOC)
   - Engage brakes and send warning to server
   - Prevent deep discharge (damages battery)

**⚠️ Per-Winch Components (Required for Ride Classification):**
- **Load Cell:** 1 per winch (2 total) - Independent tension monitoring
- **HX711 Amplifier:** 1 per winch (2 total) - One amplifier per load cell
- **Electromagnetic Brake:** 1 per winch (2 total) - Independent brake control
- **Relay Module:** 1 per winch (2 total) - One relay per brake

This redundancy is essential if the system is classified as a ride by any state, as it provides independent monitoring and safety control for each winch.

**Note:** DIY H-Bridge option reduces cost by ~$100-150 per winch, but requires more engineering.

**Battery Cost Notes:**
- Battery cost varies significantly by capacity and quality
- 50 Ah battery: ~$200-300 (1-2 hour sessions)
- 100 Ah battery: ~$400-600 (full-day operation)
- 200 Ah battery: ~$800-1200 (extended operation, multiple sessions)
- Higher capacity = longer runtime, but also higher weight and cost

### Battery Placement & Enclosure

**Mounting Location:**
- **Primary Mounting:** Battery is mounted near the base of one leg of the dual-winch truss chassis
- **Rationale:** 
  - Low center of gravity (improves stability)
  - Easy access for charging/disconnect operations
  - Protected location (less likely to be damaged during operation)
  - Weight distribution (battery weight helps stabilize truss base)
- **Mounting Method:** Secure battery box/enclosure bolted to truss leg base plate
- **Ventilation:** Ensure battery enclosure has adequate ventilation (LiFePO4 generates minimal heat, but ventilation prevents overheating)

**Battery Enclosure Design:**
- **Integrated Components:**
  - 24V LiFePO4 battery pack (50-200 Ah)
  - 10A LiFePO4 battery charger (built into enclosure)
  - Battery disconnect switch (mounted on enclosure exterior)
  - Charging extension cable storage compartment
- **Enclosure Features:**
  - Weather-resistant (IP54 or better for indoor/outdoor use)
  - Lockable access door (prevents unauthorized access during operation)
  - Ventilation slots/grilles (maintains airflow around battery)
  - Cable management (internal routing for power cables)
  - Mounting brackets (bolts to truss leg base plate)

**Charging Extension Cable:**
- **Purpose:** AC power cable for connecting battery charger to wall outlet
- **Specifications:**
  - Length: 10-15 feet (allows charging without moving battery)
  - Rating: 15A minimum (for 10A charger with safety margin)
  - Connector: Standard NEMA 5-15P (US) or appropriate for your region
  - Storage: Coiled and stowed in dedicated compartment within battery enclosure
- **Safety Protocol:**
  - **During Operation:** Extension cable must be stowed and unplugged
  - **After Hours:** Ops Tech plugs in extension cable for overnight charging
  - **Before Operation:** Ops Tech unplugs and stows extension cable
  - **Visual Check:** Ops Tech verifies cable is stowed before each session

**Cable Management:**
- **Battery to Motor Controllers:**
  - Use appropriate wire gauge for high current (8-10 AWG for battery to motor controller)
  - Keep battery cables as short as possible (reduces voltage drop)
  - Use proper connectors (Anderson PowerPole, XT90, or similar high-current connectors)
  - Route cables along truss structure (protect from pinch points and abrasion)
- **Charging Cable:**
  - Stow extension cable in dedicated compartment when not in use
  - Use cable management (velcro straps, cable ties) to keep cable organized
  - Ensure cable does not interfere with winch operation or player movement
